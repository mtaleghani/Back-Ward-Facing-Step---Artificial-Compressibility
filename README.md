## Description of the Problem
The flow past a backward-facing step is a good test case to examine the accuracy and performance of a numerical method. The geometry of this test case is simple yet contains complex flow features associated with separation and reattachment. The main difficulty is the high dependence of the recirculation regions on grid size and resolution.
